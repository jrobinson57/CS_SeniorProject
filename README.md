# CS_SeniorProject
My senior project, fullfilling the final requirement to graduate with a Computer Science Degree from Rowan Unviersity by showcasing
skills gained throughout my time learning here.

# Premise
Create an immersive three dimensional horror game that features escape-room-like gameplay. The player will start in a forest and have to collect randomly placed items to advance in the story. After collecting all the items and navigating to the exit of level one, the player will then be transported to level two. In this level, the player is now wandering through an abandoned mansion trying to collect keys to locked doors. Once the player has collected the final key, they are able to escape to a helipad and win the game.
